PROMPT 1: MCQ QUESTIONS (TEXT-BASED MULTIPLE CHOICE)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Generate 10 multiple-choice questions about "Large Language Models" in the field of Artificial Intelligence.
Difficulty Level: medium

REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY a raw JSON array. Do not wrap it in markdown code blocks (```json). Do not add conversational text before or after.
- Questions must be clear, unambiguous, and educational
- Focus on AI concepts, technologies, algorithms, ethics, applications, and current trends
- Each question must have exactly 4 options
- Include a mix of conceptual, applied, and factual questions
- Avoid yes/no questions
- Options should be plausible but only one correct
- Explanations should teach the concept, not just state the answer

OUTPUT FORMAT - Return ONLY a valid JSON array with no markdown, no code blocks, no additional text:
[
  {
    "question_text": "What is the primary advantage of using Transformers over RNNs for natural language processing?",
    "question_type": "text_mcq",
    "options": ["Lower computational cost", "Ability to process sequences in parallel", "Smaller model size", "Better performance on small datasets"],
    "correct_answer": "Ability to process sequences in parallel",
    "explanation": "Transformers use self-attention mechanisms that allow parallel processing of sequences, unlike RNNs which process sequentially. This makes them much faster to train on modern hardware.",
    "category": "Large Language Models",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "points": 10
  }
]


DIFFICULTY GUIDELINES:
- Easy: Basic definitions, well-known facts, fundamental concepts
