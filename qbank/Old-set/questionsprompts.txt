Act as an expert AI Educator and Developer. I need you to generate a JSON dataset of 50 quiz questions for an application.

**1. Output Format:**
Return ONLY a raw JSON array. Do not wrap it in markdown code blocks (```json). Do not add conversational text before or after.

**2. JSON Structure Object:**
Each object in the array must follow this exact schema:
{
  "id": (integer, sequential starting from 11),
  "type": (string, either "text_mcq", "image_identify_logo", or "image_identify_person"),
  "category": (string, choose from: "Latest Developments", "AI Safety", "Robotics", "Quantum Computing", "Generative AI"),
  "difficulty": (string, "easy", "medium", or "hard"),
  "question": (string),
  "imageUrl": (string, OPTIONAL: Only required if type is not "text_mcq". Use reliable, public Wikimedia Commons URLs ending in .jpg, .png, or .svg),
  "options": (array of 4 strings),
  "correct_answer": (string, MUST be an exact match to one of the options)
}

**3. Content Requirements:**
- **Quantity:** Generate exactly 50 questions.
- **Topics:** Balance the questions across these categories:
   - Latest AI Developments (GPT-4, Gemini, Sora, Llama 3)
   - AI Safety (Alignment, Bias, Hallucinations, Regulation)
   - Robotics (Humanoids, Boston Dynamics, Sensors)
   - Quantum Computing (Qubits, Superposition, Entanglement)
- **Image Questions:** Include at least 10 questions that require an image (identifying logos of AI companies or famous AI scientists).
- **Distractors:** Ensure the wrong options are plausible but clearly incorrect.

**4. Quality Control:**
- Ensure valid JSON syntax (close all brackets and braces).
- Ensure the `correct_answer` is strictly present in the `options` array.





I need a dataset of AI-related 'Identify the Logo' quiz questions in JSON format.

Requirements:

Format: Use the JSON structure below.

Content: The question must show a logo of a famous AI company or Tool.

Options: Provide 4 options. All 4 must be similar organizations (competitors) to make it challenging.

Images: Use reliable, public URLs for the logos (preferably Wikimedia Commons or official GitHub assets that allow hotlinking).

Quantity: Generate [INSERT NUMBER] questions.

JSON Structure:

JSON

{
  "id": 1,
  "type": "image_identify_logo",
  "category": "Brands",
  "difficulty": "medium",
  "question": "Identify the organization behind this logo.",
  "imageUrl": "LINK_TO_LOGO_IMAGE",
  "options": ["Competitor A", "Competitor B", "Correct Answer", "Competitor C"],
  "correct_answer": "Correct Answer"
}



Act as an expert AI Historian and Tech Educator. I need a JSON dataset of quiz questions where the user must identify famous personalities in Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science, and Tech.

**1. Output Format:**
Return ONLY a raw JSON array. Do not wrap it in markdown code blocks. Do not add conversational text.

**2. JSON Structure Object:**
Each object must follow this exact schema:
{
  "id": (integer, sequential starting from 201),
  "type": "image_identify_person",
  "category": "Personalities",
  "difficulty": (string, "easy", "medium", or "hard"),
  "question": "Who is this figure, known for [SHORT 3-5 WORD DESCRIPTION]?",
  "imageUrl": (string, MUST be a direct link to a Wikimedia Commons image ending in .jpg or .png. Do NOT use generic placeholder URLs.),
  "options": (array of 4 names. 1 correct, 3 plausible distractors from the tech world),
  "correct_answer": (string, MUST be an exact match to one of the options)
}

**3. Content Requirements:**
- **Quantity:** Generate 20 questions.
- **Subjects:** Focus on Turing Award winners, Deep Learning pioneers, CEOs of major AI companies, and historical figures.
- **Specific Figures to Include:**
   - The "Godfathers of AI" (Hinton, Bengio, LeCun)
   - Founders (Sam Altman, Demis Hassabis, Elon Musk)
   - Historical (Alan Turing, Ada Lovelace, Grace Hopper)
   - Modern Researchers (Fei-Fei Li, Andrew Ng, Andrej Karpathy)
- **Distractors:** If the answer is a female researcher, all options must be women. If the answer is a CEO, options should be other CEOs.

**4. Example Output:**
{
  "id": 201,
  "type": "image_identify_person",
  "category": "Personalities",
  "difficulty": "easy",
  "question": "Who is this computer scientist, considered the father of theoretical computer science and AI?",
  "imageUrl": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Alan_Turing_Aged_16.jpg",
  "options": ["John von Neumann", "Alan Turing", "Charles Babbage", "Tim Berners-Lee"],
  "correct_answer": "Alan Turing"
}

Act as an expert AI Historian and Quiz Developer. I need a JSON dataset of "Identify the Personality" questions focusing on famous figures in Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Tech.

**1. Output Format:**
Return ONLY a raw JSON array. Do not wrap it in markdown code blocks.

**2. JSON Structure:**
Each object must follow this schema:
{
  "id": (integer, sequential starting from 51),
  "type": "image_identify_person",
  "category": "Personalities",
  "difficulty": (string, "easy", "medium", or "hard"),
  "question": (string, e.g., "Identify this Turing Award winner and 'Godfather of AI'."),
  "imageUrl": (string, MUST be a direct URL to a public domain image, preferably from Wikimedia Commons, ending in .jpg or .png),
  "options": (array of 4 strings. ONE is the correct name. THE OTHER THREE must be other famous AI/Tech personalities to serve as challenging distractors),
  "correct_answer": (string, exact match to the correct option)
}

**3. Content Requirements:**
- **Quantity:** Generate 20 high-quality questions.
- **Subjects:** Focus on these specific groups:
   - **The "Godfathers":** Geoffrey Hinton, Yann LeCun, Yoshua Bengio.
   - **The CEOs:** Sam Altman (OpenAI), Demis Hassabis (DeepMind), Jensen Huang (NVIDIA), Satya Nadella (Microsoft).
   - **The Researchers:** Fei-Fei Li (ImageNet), Andrew Ng (Coursera/Google Brain), Ian Goodfellow (GANs), Andrej Karpathy.
   - **Historical Figures:** Alan Turing, Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy.
   - **Allied Tech:** Elon Musk (Tesla/SpaceX), Boston Dynamics founders.

**4. Distractor Logic (Crucial):**
- Do NOT use random names like "John Doe."
- If the answer is a **CEO**, the options must be **other CEOs**.
- If the answer is a **Researcher**, the options must be **other Researchers**.
- *Example:* If the answer is "Yann LeCun", the options should be ["Geoffrey Hinton", "Yann LeCun", "Yoshua Bengio", "Andrew Ng"].

**5. Verification:**
- Ensure the `imageUrl` is a real, working link to a specific person's photo.
- Ensure the `correct_answer` is strictly present in the `options` array.
