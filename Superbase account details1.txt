🎉 Deployment Successful!

Your AI Quiz Application has been successfully deployed to Vercel!

🌐 Deployment URLs:
Production URL: https://playqzv3-p0dkox46i-dddps-projects-7fbb824f.vercel.app
⚠️ Important Next Steps:
1. Configure Environment Variables
You need to add your Supabase credentials to Vercel:

Go to your Vercel Dashboard
Select the playqzv3 project
Go to Settings → Environment Variables
Add the following variables:
VITE_SUPABASE_URL = Your Supabase project URL
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = Your Supabase anonymous key
2. Redeploy After Adding Environment Variables
After adding the environment variables, trigger a new deployment:

bash
vercel --prod
Or you can redeploy from the Vercel dashboard.

3. Update Supabase CORS Settings
Add your Vercel domain to Supabase's allowed origins:

Go to your Supabase Dashboard
Navigate to Settings → API
Add https://playqzv3-p0dkox46i-dddps-projects-7fbb824f.vercel.app to the allowed origins
4. Optional: Set Up Custom Domain
You can configure a custom domain in Vercel's project settings under Domains.

Note: The application won't work properly until you add the Supabase environment variables and redeploy!
