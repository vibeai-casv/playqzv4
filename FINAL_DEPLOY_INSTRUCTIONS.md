# 🚀 Final Production Build Ready (Update 2)

The frontend has been rebuilt with the **Quiz Config** improvements!

## 📦 What's New

1.  **Dynamic Topics**: The "Topics" list in Quiz Config now pulls directly from the database. No more hardcoded categories!
2.  **Select All**: Added a "Select All / Deselect All" button to easily toggle all topics.
3.  **Validation**: Updated to accept any topic name found in the database.

## 📂 Deployment Steps

### 1. Upload Frontend (The App)

Upload all files from the `dist` folder to your server's public root (`public_html`).

*   **Source:** `e:\projects\playqzv4\client\dist\*`
*   **Destination:** `/public_html/`
*   **Action:** Overwrite ALL files.

*(No backend changes required for this update)*

**You are ready to go live!** 🚀
